# ArcGIS API Lite for Flex

This library provides an open source framework and sample apps for getting started with the ArcGIS API for Flex.

## Features

The ArcGIS API Lite for Flex enables you to embed mapping capabilities into
your Flex projects very easily. It rivals in simplicity with other popular mapping
APIs such as those from Google, Yahoo, etc, and provides a comprehensive collection of
maps to utilize (Topographic and Street maps, Imagery, Shaded Relief, etc) in your
projects. It also offers unique analytical capabilities such as calculating drive-time polygons and others.
This API is available as a developer sample under the Apache 2.0 license and can
be downloaded from GitHub. The ArcGIS API Lite for Flex is built as a framework library around the
powerful ArcGIS API for Flex, a more advanced API for building GIS web applications.

### Why did Esri create the ArcGIS API Lite for Flex?

Esri is the leading provider of advanced GIS capabilities in the market today.
While very powerful, its ArcGIS API for Flex is more sophisticated than other popular
mapping APIs available. We wanted to create a simpler API that would introduce the
average non-GIS expert into the great opportunities that GIS has to offer.
