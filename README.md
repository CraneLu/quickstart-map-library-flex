# ArcGIS API Lite for Flex

This library provides an open source framework and sample apps for getting started with the ArcGIS API for Flex.

Version: v2

The ArcGIS API Lite for Flex enables you to embed mapping capabilities into
your Flex projects very easily. It rivals in simplicity with other popular mapping
APIs such as those from Google, Yahoo, etc, and provides a comprehensive collection of
maps to utilize (Topographic and Street maps, Imagery, Shaded Relief, etc) in your
projects. It also offers unique analytical capabilities such as calculating drive-time polygons and others.
This API is available as a developer sample under the Apache 2.0 license and can
be downloaded from GitHub. The ArcGIS API Lite for Flex is built as a framework library around the
powerful ArcGIS API for Flex, a more advanced API for building GIS web applications.

## Common Questions:

### Why did Esri create the ArcGIS API Lite for Flex?

Esri is the leading provider of advanced GIS capabilities in the market today.
While very powerful, its ArcGIS API for Flex is more sophisticated than other popular
mapping APIs available. We wanted to create a simpler API that would introduce the
average non-GIS expert into the great opportunities that GIS has to offer.

### Why should I use this API instead of Google, Yahoo, or others?

1. The ArcGIS API Lite for Flex offers many base maps including: Street, Imagery,
   Shaded Relief, World Topographic, US Topographic and Ocean Base maps. Other APIs only provide
   a small limited number of base maps to utilize.
2. In addition to the popular operations commonly found in the other APIs (e.g., find
   addresses, navigating the map, simple graphics handling, etc.), the ArcGIS API Lite
   for Flex features unique analytical capabilities such as determining drive-time polygons.
3. The API and its source code are licensed under Apache 2.0, giving you the freedom to
   adapt it to your specific business needs
4. With other APIs, you are limited to simple mapping. They do not offer a "next level"
   to advance to if desired. The ArcGIS API Lite for Flex is a great introduction to the
   power of the ArcGIS API for Flex: a full featured library for geographic analysis on the web.
   In fact, you could potentially leverage both within the same application if desired.
5. No user keys or tokens are needed. You simply download the API and start developing.
6. Unlike other APIs, you retain all rights over your data.
